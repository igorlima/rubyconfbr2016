A walk through realtime databases: Powering the next gen of JS apps

[This talk](http://codepen.io/igorribeirolima/pen/EgkZWd) covers a way on how to focus on front-end development and not spend hours on server-side work. The use of DBaaS - DataBase as a Service - allows us to focus on what JS developer likes - JS stuff. No matter which framework you are familiar with: ReactJS, AngularJS, Backbone, EmberJS, and so forth. DBaaS fits any JS library/framework. It gives us many advantages. During the talk, there will be few examples using AppBase and Firebase. Both are DBaaS platforms. These examples cover details on how getting started, setting up and so on.

Enjoy and take advantages. Slides are here: [http://codepen.io/igorribeirolima/pen/EgkZWd](http://codepen.io/igorribeirolima/pen/EgkZWd)
